üîß EC2 Lifecycle Automation with Python
Automating EC2 creation, dynamic inventory generation, metadata management, and instance lifecycle control

‚úÖ Project Overview
This project is a complete Python-based solution designed to automate the entire lifecycle of Amazon EC2 instances ‚Äî from instance creation to termination ‚Äî while integrating intelligent features like dynamic inventory generation, metadata tracking, and configuration-ready outputs for tools like Ansible.

Built with modularity and reusability in mind, this system enables developers and DevOps teams to launch, configure, and manage EC2 instances with minimal manual intervention.

üß† Key Features & Functionalities
1. Dynamic EC2 Instance Creation
Supports launching single or multiple instances in one flow
Fully interactive ‚Äî allows user input to:
Select AMI by name (with automatic mapping to AMI ID)
Specify instance type, count, key pair, and region
Assign both Name and additional Tags
Gracefully handles multiple AMIs in batch operations

2. Automated Inventory Generation
Builds a dynamic Ansible-style inventory directly from AWS
Grouping options include:
OS-based (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, etc.)
Custom tags or name conventions
One group per instance or per tag
Output is ready to use for configuration management

3. Comprehensive Metadata Collection
On instance launch or listing, collects:
Instance ID
Public/Private IP and DNS
Launch time, region, platform, and more
Displays metadata in a clean, structured format
Includes optional export or parsing for scripting

4. Instance Management (List, Filter, Rename, Terminate)
Real-time filtering of running instances
By Name, AMI, platform, tags, etc.
Dynamic renaming of instances by tag/ID
Bulk or selective termination of instances with confirmation
Includes safe checks to avoid accidental termination

5. Infrastructure as Code Readiness
Output inventory directly usable by Ansible playbooks
Encourages immutable infrastructure practices
Lays the foundation for scalable, reproducible environments

üìÅ Tools & Technologies
Language: Python 3
Libraries: boto3, json, os, re, datetime, uuid, etc.
AWS Services: EC2, IAM (Key Pairs), Tags, Regions, AMIs
DevOps Integration: Inventory output compatible with Ansible

üß© Challenges Solved
Ensured that no instances launch without proper naming or tags, even when creating multiple instances
Allowed dynamic user-driven grouping in inventories for scalability
Implemented clean UX for CLI-based management, reducing AWS Console dependency

üåç Use Case & Scalability
Ideal for:
DevOps teams needing quick environment spin-ups
Training labs or test environments with multiple AMIs
Automation scripts where infrastructure must be defined dynamically
Extensible for cloud-init, user-data injection, or future containerized setups

üößFuture Work & Improvements
This tool is under active development and several enhancements are planned to make it more robust, user-friendly, and production-ready:
 EC2 Key Pair and Security Group Management from within the tool.
 Persistent configuration files to avoid repeated user inputs.
 Error recovery & rollback mechanisms for partial failures.
 Web interface using Flask or Streamlit for broader accessibility.
 SSH remote execution integration after instance creation.
 Integration with AWS SSM for more secure access.
 Support for launching Spot Instances and Reserved Instances.
This version is functional but not final. Continuous improvements, modularization, and testing are ongoing. Your feedback or collaboration is welcome.
